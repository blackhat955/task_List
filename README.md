### About:
- Flash chat is intended to provide a better user experience during chatting with other people. This is something by which I am trying to learn how the messaging app like WhatsApp, Twitter, Snapchat is working and try to make my app something near to it. For this, I will be actively searching   for collaborators to enhance the end-user  experience
